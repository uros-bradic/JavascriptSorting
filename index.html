        Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be
        inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The
        returned value should be a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, getIndexToIns([1, 2, 3, 4], 1.5) should return 1 because it
        is greater than 1 (which has index 0), but less than 2 (which has index
        1).
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, getIndexToIns([20, 3, 5], 19) should return 2 because once the
        array has been sorted it will look like [3, 5, 20] and 19 is less than
        20 (index 2) and greater than 5 (index 1).
